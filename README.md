# Van Helsing's Big Missed Stake
## A Very Silly "Throw the stick very far" game. 


This is a Game Maker Studio game that I created over the course of 96 hours (or closer to twelve in this case) in early 2021 for the GMC community game jam #41.
[See result topic on the forum](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/gmc-jam-41-results.86845/)The game ended up in 6th place out of 25.

As with most jam games this project was put together incredibly quickly under stressful circumstances, 
and the code quality reflects that. It's not intended to be good or well written code wise, 
all it needed was to work more often than not once sent out to the world.
